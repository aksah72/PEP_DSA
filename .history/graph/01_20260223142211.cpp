/*
A graph G = (V,E) consist of : 

V -> Set of Vertices(nodes) -> An individual object in Graph
E -> Set of edges connecting pairs of vertices

-- Directed Graph    -> edges have direction
-- Undirected Graph  -> edges have no direction
-- Weighted Graph    -> edges have values(weight/cost/distance)
-- Unweighted Grapg
