/*
A graph G = (V,E) consist of : 

V -> Set of Vertices(nodes) -> An individual object in Graph
E -> Set of edges connecting pairs of vertices

-- Directed Graph    -> edges have direction
-- Undirected Graph  -> edges have no direction
-- Weighted Graph    -> edges have values(weight/cost/distance)
-- Unweighted Graph

* Path -> A sequence of vertices connected edges

* Cycle -> A path that start and end at the same vertices

* Degree -> In undirected graph -> number of edge connected to the vertex

In directed grap
